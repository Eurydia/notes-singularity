# Singularity

**Singularity** is a small digital garden I started with a simple goal in mind; to immortalized everything I have ever learned. The motivation was also rather simple. Learning is time consuming, but the things we learn are so easily forgotten. I have watched a video by [ChubbyEmu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKOvOaJv4GK-oDqx-sj7VVg) that I have since forgot the name of. From the video, one thing Dr. Bernard said stuck with me, and I will paraphrase it here; "one is forgotten becomes new again."

It takes time to learn, and if we forget, we need to invest more time to re-learn. With **Singularity**, I can sleep in peace knowing that I will never forget, nor will I ever have to re-learn anything, anymore.

## Backup redundancy

Originally, **Singularity** started as an Obsidian vault, but as the saying goes "one is none, two is one," it does not hurt to have some redundancy in place. In the worst case scenario when my hard drive is corrupted, this repository will be one of the backups.

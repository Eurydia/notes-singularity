# Trigonometric Functions

## Basic functions

### Sine

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\sin(\theta) = \frac {opposite} {hypotenuse} 

\end{align*}
$$

**Opposite** refer the side length that is opposite to the angel $x$.

On a unit circle, sine expresses the $y$ or the **vertical component** of the coordinate.

This means that $sin(0) = 0$.

# Binary relation

## Ordered pair

**Definition**: An ordered pair $(A, B)$ is a mathematical object, where the components $A,B$ are sets, called the **first** and **second coordinate**, respectively. Two ordered pairs $(A,B), (X,Y)$ are equal if and only if $A=X$ and $B=Y$.

Ordered pairs can be defined in different equivalent ways, as long as the definition satisfy the equality requirement. The widely-accepted definition is given by **Kazimierz Kuratowski**, which defined an ordered pair as

$$(X,Y):=\{\{X\},\{X,Y\}\}.$$

## Binary relation

**Definition**: A binary relation is a set of **ordered pairs** $(a,b)$

# Ordered pairs

An ordered pair, denoted by $(A, B)$ is a mathematical object constructed from **sets**. The components $A,B$ are sets, called the **first** and **second coordinate**, respectively.

Essentially, two ordered pairs $(A,B), (X,Y)$ are equal if and only if $A=X$ and $B=Y$.

Ordered pairs can be defined in different equivalent ways, as long as the definition satisfy the equality requirement.

## Kuratowski's definition

The current widely-accepted definition of an ordered pairs is given by **Kazimierz Kuratowski**;

$$(X,Y):=\{\{X\},\{X,Y\}\}$$

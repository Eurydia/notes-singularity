# Correlation

Correlation is a [[Statistics|statistical]] measure that describes the degree of association or relationship between two [[Singularity/Mathematics/Statistics/Variable|variables]]. 
It indicates how changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable. 

Correlation does not imply causation, but it helps quantify the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

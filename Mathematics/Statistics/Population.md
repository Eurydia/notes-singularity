# Population 

In [[Statistics|statistics]], a population refers to the entire group of individuals, items, or events that meet certain criteria and are the subject of a statistical study. 

The population is the complete set from which a sample is drawn. 

The goal of statistical analysis is often to make inferences about the characteristics of the population based on observations and analyses conducted on a representative subset of that population, which is known as a [[Singularity/Mathematics/Statistics/Sample|sample]].

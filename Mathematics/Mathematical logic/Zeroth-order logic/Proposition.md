# Proposition

A proposition is a statement which is either true or false.

## Atomic proposition

An atomic proposition is a proposition which does not contain [[logical connectives]].

Atomic propositions are the most basic elements in [[Zeroth-order logic (index)]].
They are also known as "atomic formulas" and "terminal elements".

## Compound proposition

A compound proposition is formed by connecting propositions with logical connectives.

Compound propositions are also known as "complex formulas".

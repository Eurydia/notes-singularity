# Formal fallacy

A formal fallacy is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid. 

Such an argument is always considered to be wrong. 
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion. 
Both may actually be true or may even be more probable as a result of the argument, but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

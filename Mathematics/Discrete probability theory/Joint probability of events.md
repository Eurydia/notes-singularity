# Joint probability of events

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

The joint probability of two events $a$ and $b$ in the [[Event space|event space]] $\mathcal{F}$, denoted by $P(a \cap b)$ or $P(a, b)$, represents the probability that both event $a$ and event $b$ will occur simultaneously as a result of one random experiment.

Consider a random experiment of rolling a fair six-sided dice once with $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
An event $e$ represents the number is even, and an event $p$ represents the outcomes where the number is a prime.

The joint probability of $e$ and $p$ is $P(e\cap p)=\frac{1}{6}$.

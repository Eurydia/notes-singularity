# Discrete probability space

A discrete probability space is an ordered triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ where:

**Sample space**

The finite non-empty set $\Omega$ is called the [[Sample space|sample space]].

**Event space**

The finite set $\mathcal{F}$ is called the [[Event space|event space]].

**Probability measure**

The function $P:\mathcal{F}\to[0,1]$ is called the [[Probability measure|probability measure]].

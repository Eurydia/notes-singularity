# Mutually exclusive events

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

Two events $a$ and $b$ in the [[Event space|event space]] $\mathcal{F}$ are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur simultaneously.

Consider a random experiment of tossing a coin once, the events "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive because it is impossible for both outcomes to happen simultaneously.

# Partition of a set

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

A partition of the sample space $\Omega$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $\Omega$ such that every outcome $\omega$ in $\Omega$ is in exactly one of these subsets.

Consider a partition $K:=\{k_{1}, k_{2},\ldots, k_{n}\}$ of $\Omega$.
Each $k_{i}$ in $K$ is non-empty.
For two distinct $k_{i}$ and $k_{j}$ where $i\ne j$, $k_{i}\cap k_{j}=\emptyset$.
Additionally, $k_{1}\cup k_{2}\cup\ldots\cup k_{n}=\Omega$.

The sets $k_{1}, k_{2}, \ldots$ are called cells of partition $K$.

A sample space can have more than partition.

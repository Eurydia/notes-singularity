# Sample

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

A sample is an element or combination of elements drawn from the sample space $\Omega$. 
It can be represented as a finite set of outcomes.

A sample captures the specific outcomes or events observed or measured during an experiment within the given probability space.

For example, the sample space $\Omega=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ represents the outcomes of rolling a six-sided die, a sample could be a single outcome like $\{3\}$ or a combination of outcomes like $\{2, 4, 6\}$.

The interpretation for $\{3\}$ is rolling a three, and $\{2,4,6\}$ is rolling either a two, four, or six.

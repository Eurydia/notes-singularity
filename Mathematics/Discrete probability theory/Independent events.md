# Independent events

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

Two events $a$ and $b$ in the [[Event space|event space]] $\mathcal{F}$ are independent if the occurrence of one  does not affect the probability of the other.
In other words, $a$ and $b$ are independent if $P(a\cap b) = P(a)\cdot P(b)$.

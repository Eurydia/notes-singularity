# Conditional probability of events

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

The conditional probability of two events $a$ and $b$ in the [[Event space|event space]] $\mathcal{F}$, denoted by $P(b|a)$ or $P_{a}(b)$, represents the probability of event $b$ occurring, given that event $a$ has occurred.

When written as $P(a|b)$, the meaning changes to "the probability of event $a$ occurring, given that event $b$ has already occurred."

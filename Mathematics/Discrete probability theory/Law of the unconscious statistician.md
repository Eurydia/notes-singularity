# Law of the unconscious statistician

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

The theorem expresses the [[Expected value|expected value]] of a function $g(X)$ of a [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]] $X$ in terms of $g$ and the probability distribution of $X$.

If the [[Probability mass function|probability mass function]] $p_{X}$is known, the expected value of $g(X)$ is expressed as:

$$
E[g(X)] = \sum\limits_{x} g(x)\cdot p_{X}(x)
$$

for all $x\in(-\infty, \infty)$.

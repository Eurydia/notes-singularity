# Standard deviation

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

Standard deviation, denoted by $\sigma$, measures the amount of [[Variance|variation]] of a [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]] expected about its [[Expected value|expected value]].

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the expected value, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. 

The standard deviation of a discrete random variable $X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ is obtained from taking square root of its variance:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}.

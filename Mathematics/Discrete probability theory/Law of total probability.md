# Law of total probability

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

Let $K=\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}\}$ be a [[Parition of a set|partition]] of the [[Sample space|sample space]] $\Omega$, for any event $b$ in the same sample space, its probability is obtained by:

$$
P(b) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} P(b\cap A_{i})P(A_{i})
$$

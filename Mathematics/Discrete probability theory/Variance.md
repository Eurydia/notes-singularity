# Variance

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Discrete probability space|discrete probability space]].

Variance, denoted by $\sigma^{2}$ or $\text{Var}(X)$, measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from the [[Singularity/Mathematics/Probability theory/Expected value|expected value]].

The variance of a [[Discrete random variable|discrete random variable]] $X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ with [[Probability mass function|probability mass function]] $p_{X}:\mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ is expressed as:

$$
\text{Var}(X)=\sum\limits_{x} (x-E[X])^{2}\cdot p_{X}(x)
$$

for all $x\in(-\infty,\infty)$.

# Multigraph

An ordered triple $G=(\phi, E, V)$ is called a graph if $E$ and $V$ are sets, $V\ne\varnothing$, $V\cap E=\varnothing$, and $\phi: E\to\{\{v,v'\} : v,v'\in V\}$.

$E$ is called the set of edges (lines), $V$ is called the set of vertices (nodes), and $\phi$ is called the incidence function, which maps each element in $E$ to a pair of unordered elements in $V$.

## Graph

There are four different mathematical objects which are considered **graph** based on their properties. Namely;
- **undirected simple graph**
- **directed simple graph**
- **undirected multigraph**
- **directed multigraph**

### Undirected simple graph

An **undirected simple graph** $G$ is a an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of **vertices** and $E$ is a set of unordered pairs $\{v_{1},v_{2}\}\in V^{2}$.

The vertices $v_{1},v_{2}$ are called **endpoints** of the edge $\{v_{1},v_{2}\}$. In other words, the edge $\{v_{1},v_{2}\}$ is said to join the vertex $v_{1}$ with $v_{2}$, and vice versa. 

The edge $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\}$ is **incident** on $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$.

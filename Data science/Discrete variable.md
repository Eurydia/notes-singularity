# Discrete variable

A discrete variable is a type of [[Types of variable#Numerical|quantitative variable]] that can only take on specific, distinct values and is typically counted in whole numbers. 

Unlike [[Continuous variable|continuous variables]], which can theoretically assume any value within a range, discrete variables have a finite or countably infinite set of possible values. 

Discrete variables are often associated with counting and are used to represent data that can be counted in individual units.

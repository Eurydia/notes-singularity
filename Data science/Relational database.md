# Relational database

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which are related to each other based on common fields.

Relational databases are widely used due to their ability to model complex relationships and ensure data consistency. 
They are particularly well-suited for scenarios where structured data and well-defined relationships are crucial.

# Data-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid

The DIKW pyramid, also known as the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom pyramid, represents a hierarchical framework that illustrates the relationships between different stages of information processing and understanding. 

## Data

At the base of the pyramid is "Data." 

Data refers to raw facts, symbols, or observations without any context or interpretation. 
It is the most basic level of information and lacks meaning on its own.

## Information

Information is the result of organizing and processing data to give it context and meaning. 
It provides a structure or framework that allows data to be interpreted and understood.

Information answers the questions of "what," "where," and "when."

## Knowledge 

Knowledge involves synthesizing information to gain a deeper understanding of relationships and patterns. 
It represents insights, concepts, and principles derived from information. 

Knowledge answers the question of "how" and often involves understanding the reasons behind certain phenomena.

## Wisdom 

Wisdom is the application of knowledge in a practical and judicious manner. 
It involves making sound decisions, solving problems effectively, and knowing when and how to apply knowledge to achieve desirable outcomes. 

Wisdom incorporates a level of judgment, experience, and ethical considerations.

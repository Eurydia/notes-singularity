# Ordinal variable

An ordinal variable is a type of [[Types of variable#Categorical|categorical variable]].

The categories of an ordinal variable represent distinct levels or ranks, but the intervals between the levels are not necessarily uniform or meaningful. 

In other words, the differences between the categories are not consistent.

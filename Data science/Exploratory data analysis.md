# Exploratory data analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process that involves visually and statistically summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. 
The primary goal of EDA is to gain insights into the structure, relationships, and patterns within the data, as well as to identify potential outliers and anomalies. 

EDA is often conducted before formal modeling and hypothesis testing, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.

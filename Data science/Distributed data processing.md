# Distributed data processing

Distributed data and processing refer to the practice of distributing data storage and computational tasks across multiple nodes or machines within a network. 

The goal of distributed data and processing is to achieve better scalability, fault tolerance, and performance by leveraging the capabilities of multiple interconnected nodes.

This approach contrasts with a centralized system where data is stored in a single location, and processing tasks are performed on a single machine.

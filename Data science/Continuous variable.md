# Continuous variable

A continuous variable is a [[Types of variable#Numerical|quantitative variable]] that can take any value within a given range. 

Unlike [[Types of variable#Categorical|categorical variables]], which are discrete and fall into distinct categories, continuous variables can represent an infinite number of possible values. 
These variables are often associated with measurements and numerical data.

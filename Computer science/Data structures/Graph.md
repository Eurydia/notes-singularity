# Graph

**Definition**: A graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the **undirected graph** and **directed graph** concepts from the field of graph theory.

A graph data structure consists of a finite set of vertices, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges.

**Definition**: A vertex $x$ said to be adjacent to a vertex $y$ if there exists an edge from $x$ to $y$.

## Graph representation

**Definition**: An **adjacency list** represents the a graph by associating

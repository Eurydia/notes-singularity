# Queue

**Definition**: A **Queue** is an ordered collection of elements. Elements in a queue are removed in the same order in which they are inserted, called **first-in-first-out**.

## Common operations

**Definition**: The **ENQUEUE** operation adds an element to the end of the queue.

**Definition**: The **DEQUEUE** operation removes the first element from the queue.

### Complexity 

**Theorem**: The time complexity of **ENQUEUE** and **DEQUEUE** operations is $O(1)$.

**Theorem**: Indexing an element in a queue has $O(n)$ where $n$ is the size of the queue.

**Theorem**: The space complexities of a queue is $\Theta(n)$ are $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in a queue.

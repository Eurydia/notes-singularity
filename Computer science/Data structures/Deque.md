# Deque

**Definition**: A **Deque** is an ordered collection of elements. Elements of a deque can be added or removed from the front and the back.

Queues and stacks can be thought of as specialized deques.



## Common operations

The time complexity of deque operations is $O(1)$ with the assumption that there is no memory allocation and deallocation cost overhead.

Indexing a random element of a deque has $O(n)$ time complexity where $n$ is the size of the deque.

### PUSH FRONT operastion

**Definition**: The **PUSH FRONT** operation inserts an element into the head of a deque.

### PUSH LAST operation

**Definition**: The **PUSH LAST** operation inserts an element into the tail of a deque.

### POP FIRST operation 

**Definition**: The **POP FIRST** operation removes an element from the head of a deque.

### **POP LAST** operation

**Definition**: The **POP LAST** operation removes an element from the tail of a deque.

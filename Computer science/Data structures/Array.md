# Array

**Definition**: An **array** $A$ is an ordered collection of elements. In practice, an array is a fixed-length collection of elements represented with a contiguous region in a computer's memory.

**Definition**: Accessing the $k$-th element of an array $A$, denoted by $A[k]$, is called **indexing**.

If a computer can access all of its memory locations in the same amount of time, then accessing a particular element of an array is a constant time operation.

# Stack

**Definition**: A **stack** is an ordered collection of elements. Elements of a stack are removed in the reserved order in which they are inserted, called **last-in-first-out**.

## Common operations

**Definition**: The **PUSH** operation adds an element onto the top of the stack. **Pushing** an element onto a full stack results in an error called **stack overflow**.

**Definition**: The **POP** operation removes the top-most element from the stack. **Popping** an element from an empty stack results in an error called **stack underflow**.

**Definition**: The **EMPTY** query checks whether a stack is empty or not.

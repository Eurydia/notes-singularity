# Machine learning 

Machine learning is a computational paradigm wherein algorithms are designed to enable systems to autonomously learn and improve performance based on data without being explicitly programmed. 

The core idea is to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and the refinement of performance over time, thereby enhancing the system's ability to tackle specific tasks without necessitating exhaustive, manual programming for each scenario.

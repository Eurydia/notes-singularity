# Supervised learning algorithm

Supervised machine learning algorithms are a type of [[Machine learning|machine learning]] where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. 
In a labeled dataset, each input data point is associated with the corresponding output or target value. 

The algorithm learns to map the input data to the correct output by using this labeled training data.

# Reinforcement learning algorithm

Reinforcement learning is a type of [[Machine learning|machine learning]] where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. 

The agent takes actions in the environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. 

The goal is for the agent to learn a policy, a strategy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

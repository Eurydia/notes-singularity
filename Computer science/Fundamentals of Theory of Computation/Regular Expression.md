# Regular Expression

## Linear Grammars

**Definition**: Given a context-free grammar $G=\langle N,\Sigma,P,S\rangle$, we say that $G$ is a linear grammar if production rules in $P$ are in the form of
- $(A,u)$ where $A\in N$ and $u\in\Sigma^{*}$, or
- $(A,u_{1}Bu_{2})$ where $A,B\in N$ and $u_{1},u_{2}\in\Sigma^{*}$.

In addition, we say that $G$ is a left-linear if $u_{1}=\epsilon$ for all production rules of the second variant, and we say that $G$ is a right-linear if $u_{2}=\epsilon$ for all production rules of the second variant. 

From this definition, we can observe that right-linear grammar is another name for the type-tree Chomsky's grammar.

## Linear Languages

**Definition**: Given a language $L$, we say that $L$ is a linear language if there exists a linear grammar $G$ such that $L=L(G)$. 

Similarly, we say that $L$ is left-linear if there exists a left-linear grammar $G$ and $L$ is right-linear if there exists a right-linear grammar $G$.

We can observe that right-linear language is another name for regular language in Chomsky's classification.

 **Theorem**: Every left-linear language generates a regular language.

**Axiom**: For every right-linear grammar $G$, there exists a left-linear grammar $G'$ which generates a language reversal of $L(G)$.

**Theorem**: $\mathcal{L}_{3}$ is closed under reversal.

**Theorem**: All regular languages can be generated by a left-linear grammar.

## Normal Form

**Definition**: Given a grammar $G=\langle N,\Sigma,P,S\rangle$, we say that $G$ is of *type-three normal form* if production rules are in the form of
- $(X, aY)$ where $X,Y\in N$ and $a\in\Sigma$, or
- $(X,\epsilon)$ where $X\in N$.

**Theorem**: All regular languages can be generated by a type-three normal form grammar.

## Introduction to Regular Expression

**Definition**: Given two disjointed alphabets $V,V'$ where $V'=\{\emptyset,\epsilon,\cdot,+,\ast,(,)\}$, we define a regular expression over $V$ recursively as follows;
- $\emptyset$ is a regular expression over $V$,
- $\epsilon$ is a regular expression $V$,
- $u$ is a regular expression over $V$ for every $u\in V$,
- if $u$ is a regular expression over $V$ then $u^{*}$ is also a regular expression over $V$,
- if $u$ and $v$ are regular expressions over $V$ then $(u\cdot v)$ is a regular expression over $V$, and
- if $u$ and $v$ are regular expressions over $V$ then $(u+v)$ is regular expression over $V$.

**Definition**: Given an alphabet $V$, every regular expression $R$ over $V$ determines a language $L$ over $V$. We define $L$ recursively as follows;
- $L(\emptyset):=\emptyset$,
- $L(\epsilon):=\{\epsilon\}$,
- $L(u):=\{u\}$ where $u\in V$,
- $L(R^{*}):=(L(R))^{*}$ where $R$ is regular expression over $V$,
- $L(Q\cdot R):=L(Q)L(R)$ where $Q$ and $R$ are regular expressions over $V$, and
- $L(Q\cup R):=L(Q)\cup L(R)$ where $Q$ and $R$ are regular expressions over $V$.

### Descriptive Power of Regular Expressions

**Theorem**: Every regular expression determines a regular language, and for every regular language there exists a regular expression which generates that language.
